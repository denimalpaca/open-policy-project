# Contributing

To contribute to the Open Policy Project, you can open an Issue in the Issues page to request a new policy proposal or template, or to request modifications on an existing one.

The repository may also be forked, which generates a copy under your username or organization that you can then create a new branch on. When changes are made to the new branch and pushed, a pull request (PR) can be made against the main repository and the change contributed back. More details on how to work with git [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).
