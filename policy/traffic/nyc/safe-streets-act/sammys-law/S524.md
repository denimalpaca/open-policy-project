 S. 524 2
 1 (b) A city shall not lower or raise a speed limit by more than five
 2 miles per hour pursuant to this paragraph unless such city provides
 3 written notice and an opportunity to comment to the community board or
 4 community boards established pursuant to section twenty-eight hundred of
 5 the New York city charter with jurisdiction over the area in which the
 6 lower or higher speed limit shall apply. Such notice may be provided by
 7 electronic mail and shall be provided sixty days prior to the establish-
 8 ment of such lower or higher speed limit.
 9 [27. (a) Establishment of maximum speed limits below twenty-five miles
 10 per hour at which motor vehicles may proceed on or along designated
 11 highways within such city for the explicit purpose of implementing traf-
 12 fic calming measures as such term is defined herein; provided, however,
 13 that no speed limit shall be set below fifteen miles per hour nor shall
 14 such speed limit be established where the traffic calming measure to be
 15 implemented consists solely of a traffic control sign. Establishment of
 16 such a speed limit shall, where applicable, be in compliance with the
 17 provisions of sections sixteen hundred twenty-four and sixteen hundred

 19 alter or affect the establishment of school speed limits pursuant to the
 20 provisions of section sixteen hundred forty-three of this article. For
 21 the purposes of this paragraph, "traffic calming measures" shall mean
 22 any physical engineering measure or measures that reduce the negative
 23 effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve condi-
 24 tions for non-motorized street users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.
 25 (b) Any city establishing maximum speed limits below twenty-five miles
 26 per hour pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph shall submit a
 27 report to the governor, the temporary president of the senate and the

 30 ures and speed limits lower than twenty-five miles per hour as author-
 31 ized by this paragraph. This report shall also be made available to the
 32 public by such city on its website. Such report shall include, but not
 33 be limited to the following:
 34 (i) a description of the designated highways where traffic calming
 35 measures and a lower speed limit were established and
 36 (ii) a description of the specific traffic calming measures used and
 37 the maximum speed limit established and
 38 (iii) a comparison of the aggregate type, number, and severity of
 39 accidents reported on streets on which street calming measures and lower
 40 speed limits were implemented in the year preceding the implementation
 41 of such measures and policies and the year following the implementation
 42 of such measures and policies, to the extent this information is main-
 43 tained by any agency of the state or the city.]
